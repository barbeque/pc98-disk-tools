Things to figure out:
 - [ ] Is `eb` the only byte that indicates a bootable disk in the header? There are lots of different types of boot sector (Artdink, etc)
 - [ ] What about the mixed-sector-size disks like Disk BASIC, how do they end up in FDI format?
 - [x] Is HDI format following the same header convention as FDI?
 - [ ] Tools for the Neko Project(? Virtual98?) NHD format
 - [ ] Identify hard disk images - flat, etc? Weird headers?
 - [ ] D88 conversion from FDI/HDM/etc
 - [ ] A test to see if a disk image is "bootable" (https://bauxite.sakura.ne.jp/wiki/mypad.cgi?p=PC-98x1%2Fdisk%2Fbootstrap)
